### Testing Configurable Solutions 

carden.html tests leaflet to see if this software would be applicable for the collab project and final Geom 99 project. Want a tech that can display data without loging in to AGOL. 

To complete this, I first started with the leaflet tutorial. Next, I refocused the map on the Carden area and changed the zoom. I then took a prtocted areas GDB and isolated the areas owned by NCC. This feature class was then uploaded to AGOL and added to the leaflet map. 

Would be interesting is instead of flipping between basemaps, like this tutorial https://developers.arcgis.com/esri-leaflet/samples/switching-basemaps/, we could switch between aerial images? Something to check out as that would be very useful. Maybe it would be a switch between feature layer while keeping the one with the polygons in view at all times.
