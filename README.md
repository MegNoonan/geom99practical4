### Testing Configurable Solutions 

carden.html tests leaflet to see if this software would be applicable for the collab project and final Geom 99 project. Want a tech that can display data without loging in to AGOL. 

To complete this, I first started with the leaflet tutorial. Next, I refocused the map on the Carden area and changed the zoom. I then took a prtocted areas GDB and isolated the areas owned by NCC. This feature class was then uploaded to AGOL and added to the leaflet map.
